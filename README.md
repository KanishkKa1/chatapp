# Chatting Web Application

This is a real-time chatting web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Real-time messaging between users
- Chat room functionality

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user information and chat data
- Express.js: Backend framework for handling API requests and server-side logic
- React.js: Frontend library for building the user interface
- Node.js: Runtime environment for running the server-side code
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling of the user interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd chatting-web-application`
3. Install server dependencies: `cd backend && npm install`
4. Install client dependencies: `cd ../frontend && npm install`
5. Configure environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and specify the required variables (database connection URL, secret key, etc.)
6. Start the server: `cd ../backend && npm start`
7. Start the client: `cd ../frontend && npm start`

The server will run on `http://localhost:9000`, and the client will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
